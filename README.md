# Customer_behavior_analysis
Data analytics project -  Used Python (Numpy, Pandas), SQL, and Power Bi for showcasing the Customer Behavior Analysis.

#Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to insight-driven visualization.
The objective is to convert structured business data into actionable insights using Python, MySQL, and Power BI, supported by an interactive dashboard and a summary report.

# Dataset

Structured business dataset focused on customer behavior and transactions

Key fields include customer details, purchase data, discounts, and ratings

Source: Public / simulated CSV dataset

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

MySQL: Data storage and analytical SQL queries

Power BI: Interactive dashboards and visual analysis

CSV / Excel: Data storage and intermediate outputs

# Project Workflow
Step 1: Data Loading

Imported CSV data into Python using Pandas

Validated schema, data types, and column consistency

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions and key metrics

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies

Used statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns

Step 3: Data Cleaning

Treated missing values using mean, median, and group-based methods

Standardized column names and formats

Removed duplicates and corrected invalid records

Step 4: SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Loaded cleaned data into MySQL

Wrote SQL queries to:

Analyze customer behavior

Measure discount usage

Identify top-performing products

Generate aggregated business metrics

Step 5: Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to MySQL

Built interactive visuals, including:

KPI cards (Total Sales, Customers, Discount Rate)

Bar and column charts

Filters and slicers for dynamic analysis

Step 6: Reporting

Created a concise report summarizing:

Key insights

Trends and patterns

Business recommendations

# Dashboard Highlights
